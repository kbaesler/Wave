Now that you have the latest version and still think you ve found a issue, please search through the  issue tracker  to see if anyone else has already submitted it. If you find that someone has submitted your issue already, please go to the next step anyway, but instead of submitting a new issue, comment on the one you ve found. If you can t find your issue, go to the next step.    When submitting the issue, use the following guidelines to help provide the most useful information in issue reports. The better your issue report, the higher the chance that your issue will be addressed quickly.    Title : A good title explains the problem in clear and specific terms, but is often concise enough to fit within the default summary space. One should be able to tell exactly what a issue is about just by reading the title.        Comments : Write a more detailed explanation of the problem, do not include more than one issue in one issue report and include a relevant screenshots.    Once your issue is submitted, a comment will be added at each stage in the issue life cycle. After the issue is considered fixed, you may be asked to download the latest and confirm that the fix works for you.",

What is Wave?\n#\n\n\nWave is meant to provide a simplistic approach to extending the ArcGIS and ArcFM platforms by providing simplified implementations for complex operations, frequently use call stacks, enforcing the recommended best practices and create a seamless integration.\n\n\n2. What was the motivation?\n#\n\n\nOver the years as a developer in the Geographic Information System (GIS) for Utilities industry there\ns been an increasing need for a way to make development easier as the industries needs increase in complexity.\n\n\n3. What is ArcGIS?\n#\n\n\nArcGIS\n is a comprehensive system that allows people to collect, organize, manage, analyze, communicate, and distribute geographic information. As the world\ns leading platform for building and using geographic information systems (GIS), ArcGIS is used by people all over the world to put geographic knowledge to work in government, business, science, education, and media. ArcGIS enables geographic information to be published so it can be accessed and used by anyone. The system is available everywhere using web browsers, mobile devices such as smartphones, and desktop computers.\n\n\n4. What is ArcFM?\n#\n\n\nArcFM\n is an Enterprise GIS with reliable network intelligence that provides information such as pipe water direction flows, the number of customers attached to a gas meter, and what devices are downstream of a particular fuse.\n\n\n5. Do I need both ArcFM and ArcGIS to use Wave?\n#\n\n\nWave has been developed with it\ns dependencies in mind to allow the library to be used in two different ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen only the \nArcGIS for Desktop\n is installed, you\nll want to install the \nWave Extensions for ArcGIS\n package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen both the \nArcGIS for Desktop\n and \nArcFM Solution\n, you\nll want to install the \nWave Extensions for ArcFM\n  package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Do I need a license to use Wave?\n#\n\n\nWave is open-source and doesn\nt directly require any licenses, however since both \nArcFM\n and \nArcGIS\n are commercial software packages that require licenses.\n\n\n8. Where are the packages published?\n#\n\n\nThe packages are published to the \nNuGet\n (provided by Microsoft) service to allow the community to consume the libraries without needing to download and compile the source.\n\n\n9. What\ns installed with the packages?\n#\n\n\nWhen a package is being \u201cinstalled\u201d it will be downloaded to the local machine and will modify the project in the following ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree files will be added to the project.\n\n\n\n\nLogInfo.cs\n \u2013 Contains the necessary information for using log4net configurations.\n\n\nWave.log4net.config\n \u2013 Contains the default configurations used for logging information.\n\n\npackages.config\n \u2013 Contains information about the packages that have been installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA packages folder will be added to the root of the solution. This folder will contain the contents of the packages that have been installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n*.csproj\n file will be modified to include the MSBuild targets (that are included in the packages), that will automate the ESRI and MINER component registration.\n\n\n\n\nMust\n be using the Attribute declarations on the classes.\n\n\nMust\n have the Register for COM option checked within Visual Studios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA reference to the \nlog4net\n assembly will be downloaded and added to the project (as it is a dependency of the Wave packages).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. What logging framework is used by Wave?\n#\n\n\nWe have elected to use \nlog4net\n as the logging framework.\n\n\n11. What \nlog4net\n configuration file is used?\n#\n\n\nThe \nWave.Extensions.Esri\n and \nWave.Extensions.Miner\n package have been configured to use the configuration file named \nWave.log4net.config\n (which is installed with the packages).\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration file must reside in the directory of the running application. For example, \n%PROGRAMFILES%\\ArcGIS\\Bin\n and \n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Miner and Miner\\ArcFM Solution\\Bin\n when the assemblies are used for extensions within ArcGIS for Desktop or ArcFM Solution.\n\n\n\n\n12. How are the packages distributed?\n#\n\n\nThe packages are distributed using \nNuGet\n (provided by Microsoft), which is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to add, remove and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio projects that use the .NET Framework.",
